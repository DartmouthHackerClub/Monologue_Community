A request will be much like an advanced search. User may request in many different fields excluding ID, monologue contents, etc.      

The request system will look like:

ID: ID of the request. User cannot request an ID, it will be added automatically.     
AddedDate: The date of the request. Not user defined.
Reader: Type of reader. User defined
Gender: Gender of reader. User defined
Tone: Tone of monologue. User defined
Age: Age of reader. User defined.
WrittenInPeriod: Date written. User defined.
Quality: User defined
Character: User defined
Profession: User defined
Setting: User defined     
Dialect: User defined
Length: User defined
Source: User defined
Title: User defined
Author: User defined
Playwright: User defined
Translation: User defined
Play: User defined                 
Setup: User defined     
Subjects: User defined
Comments: Additional Comments. User defined
User: Name or ID of user who added the request

Many fields can be left NULL. ID and AddedDate are not left null and are not user defined.
If anything is left out of the information provided, the comments field holds additional request comments.

For the time being, this database will only include reader, gender, tone, and age for simplicity purposes.
Of course, it will also have ID and date added as those are given. User will also be added once the user
system is completed.
